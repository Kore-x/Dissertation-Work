February 5 at 9:09am,lottie,chloe,Normal,How will she find out? As long as noone blabs it will be ok.
February 5 at 9:12am,chloe,lottie,Normal,What about stuff online

February 14 at 9:19am,jack,lottie,Grooming,That would be amazing :) xxx
February 14 at 7:20pm,lottie,chloe,Normal,OMG! Did you see what Jack said on my post on Picturegram?!? He said he loves me!!! Do you think he means it or is he just joking around?
February 14 at 7:23pm,chloe,lottie,Normal,Wow thats so exciting!! He must mean it! He wouldn't say it otherwise! Specially not somewhere public like Picturegram.
February 14 at 7:26pm,lottie,chloe,Normal,He put it in the card too! :) :) :)

February 15 at 8:45am,jack,lottie,Grooming,I don't know Lottie... I told you it was best if she didn't know about us.
February 15 at 8:48am,lottie,jack,Grooming,"I know you did, but I thought as we are serious now she needed to know. It will be much easier not having to keep a secret too. So will you come? I'm sure she will love you as much as I do xx"
February 15 at 8:52am,jack,lottie,Grooming,"Ok, I'll be there."
February 15 at 7:34pm,lottie,jack,Grooming,Are you ok? You've been really quiet all day. Are you annoyed about meeting mum?
February 15 at 8:55pm,jack,lottie,Grooming,I'm not annoyed. I just don't know if it will work out. I feel a bit funny about it.
February 15 at 9:04pm,lottie,jack,Grooming,I'm sorry :(
February 15 at 9:12pm,jack,lottie,Grooming,Its ok. You can make up for it by sending me those pics you promised me on valentines day ;) I would love to see you wearing that neacklace I bought you. I bet you look great in it xxx
February 15 at 9:16pm,lottie,jack,Grooming,Ok. Shall I use quicksnap again?
February 15 at 9:17pm,jack,lottie,Grooming,"""Yep thats the safest way. Thanks babe, can't wait to see them xxx"""
February 16 at 8:01am,jack,lottie,Grooming,You looked so amazing in those pics you sent last night babe. I went to bed dreaming of you xxx
February 16 at 8:15am,lottie,jack,Grooming,I'm glad you liked them. I was nervous. When I sent them it came up with a message saying you had screenshotted them - why did you do that?
February 16 at 8:23am,jack,lottie,Grooming,Relax! I just wanted to keep a copy of them so I could look at them whenever I want. I promise I won't show them to anyone else. I've password protected them on my computer.xx
February 16 at 8:27am,lottie,jack,Grooming,Oh ok.
February 18 at 7:15pm,liam,lottie,Normal,"""Hey Lottie. I was hanging out with some new friends today, and they were a bit creepy to be honest. They had all these photos of girls undressing. I thought I saw you in one of them - are you ok?"""
February 18 at 7:37pm,lottie,liam,Normal,You must have made a mistake. It couldn't have been me.
February 18 at 7:45pm,lottie,jack,Grooming,Some guy told me that he thinks he saw pictures of me undressed. I'm really scared. They can't really be pictures of me can they?
February 18 at 8:03pm,jack,lottie,Grooming,"""No way. Don't worry babe, it must have been someone who looks like you. I would never show anyone photos of you. I don't want other people to see my girlfriend! Anyway you used quicksnap which doesn't save them."""
February 18 at 8:04pm,lottie,jack,Grooming,But what about the ones you screenshotted?!
February 18 at 8:07pm,jack,lottie,Grooming,"""I password protected them remember. No one else can see them, I promise. xxx"""
February 19 at 10:56am,liam,lottie,Normal,"""Lottie I'm really worried about you. I was hanging out with those guys again and they had naked photos of girls this time. I'm really sure one of them wa you. Have you taken any photos like that? The guys were really creepy. I'm not going to hang out with them again, I think they are bad news. You really need to be careful."""
February 19 at 10:58am,lottie,liam,Normal,"""I haven't taken any photos like that, it can't have been me. Just leave me alone ok?"""

February 21 at 5:30pm,jack,lottie,Grooming,Are you ok Lottie? You didn't reply to my messages or texts last night. I tried calling too.
February 21 at 5:50pm,lottie,jack,Grooming,"""I'm ok, but I'm worried cos I got another message from that guy about photos. I feel really funny. I hate the thought of someone seeing photos of me like that. I'm really upset."""
February 21 at 5:54pm,jack,lottie,Grooming,"""I know, it sucks, but you have nothing to worry about. He must have made a mistake."""
February 21 at 6:25pm,chloe,lottie,Normal,Whats going on Lottie? What was Jack's message about? He was pretty harsh to me.
February 21 at 6:28pm,lottie,chloe,Normal,"""Sorry about that. Don't worry though, its fine."""
February 21 at 6:32pm,lottie,jack,Grooming,Please don't say anything else on my wall as my friends don't know about the photos. I just want to forget all about it. Please don't be rude to them either!
February 21 at 6:35pm,jack,lottie,Grooming,I'm really sorry. I just got really mad as I don't like to see you upset. I'll make it up to you I promise xxx

February 22 at 8:06pm,jack,lottie,Grooming,I want everything to be private between us. You are so special to me. Can we meet this weekend? Maybe I can meet your friends? You wanted me to a while ago didn't you? Then I can show them that I won't hurt you.

February 23 at 4:36pm,lottie,jamila,Normal,No...what were they?
February 23 at 4:37pm,jamila,lottie,Normal,"""Photos of models in underwear. They were going on about how hot they look, and how they wished girls at school look like that. That's yucky!"""

February 23 at 8:45pm,jack,lottie,Grooming,I enjoyed our chat on the phone earlier. I want you to watch the video I text you a link to. Don't watch it with your mum or brother around! It shows what I want to do with you.
February 23 at 9:01pm,lottie,chloe,Normal,Do you know any good websites that talk about safe sex and stuff?
February 23 at 9:07pm,chloe,lottie,Normal,"""Maybe, I'll check. What do you want to know? I'm worried about you."""
February 23 at 9:11pm,lottie,chloe,Normal,Nothing to worry about! I just need some info for biology class.
February 23 at 9:14pm,chloe,lottie,Normal,Pheww. You would tell me if something was going on wouldn't you?

February 24 at 4:22pm,lottie,jack,Grooming,I know I can trust you...but I just feel funny about them. I hate the thought of other people looking at my body. I feel self conscious now.
February 24 at 4:25pm,jack,lottie,Grooming,But you look amazing! You are the most gorgeous girl I have ever seen. I wish I could see you in real life like you were in those photos. We could do the stuff in the video tomorrow night. I love you. xxx

Mar-03,8:35pm,lottie,jack,Me too. It's going to be so much fun.
Mar-03,8:40pm,jack,lottie,Have you thought about what you're going to wear?
Mar-03,8:45pm,lottie,jack,Not really. Jeans and a top probably.
Mar-03,8:50pm,jack,lottie,You should wear something sexy. Show off your amazing body. ;)
Mar-03,8:55pm,lottie,jack,I don't know... I don't want to look like I'm trying too hard.
Mar-03,9:00pm,jack,lottie,Don't worry about that. You'll look incredible no matter what you wear. But I'd love to see you in something hot.
Mar-03,9:05pm,lottie,jack,Ok, I'll think about it.
Mar-03,9:10pm,jack,emily,What are you going to wear to the party, Emily?
Mar-03,9:15pm,emily,jack,I'm not sure yet. Probably just a dress.
Mar-03,9:20pm,jack,emily,You should wear something that shows off your figure. You're so hot.
Mar-03,9:25pm,emily,jack, Lol thanks. I'll see what I can do.
Mar-04,8:45pm,jack,lottie,I can't stop thinking about you. I wish we could be together right now.
Mar-04,8:50pm,lottie,jack,Me too. Only one more day until the party.
Mar-04,8:55pm,jack,lottie,I know, I can't wait. Hey, have you ever played truth or dare?
Mar-04,9:00pm,lottie,jack,Yeah, of course.
Mar-04,9:05pm,jack,lottie,We should play it at the party. It'll be fun.
Mar-04,9:10pm,lottie,jack,Ok, sounds good.
Mar-04,9:15pm,jack,emily,We're going to play truth or dare at the party. You up for it?
Mar-04,9:20pm,emily,jack,Sure, sounds like fun.

Mar-06,10:30am,lottie,emily,Hey Em, did you get home ok last night?
Mar-06,10:45am,emily,lottie,Yeah, I did. You?
Mar-06,10:50am,lottie,emily,Yep. Did you have fun at the party?
Mar-06,10:55am,emily,lottie,Yeah, it was ok. Some of those dares were a bit much though.
Mar-06,11:00am,lottie,emily,I know what you mean. Jack kept trying to get me to do stuff with him.
Mar-06,11:05am,emily,lottie,He was doing the same with me. I didn't feel comfortable with it.
Mar-06,11:10am,lottie,emily,Me neither. I thought it was just me.
Mar-06,11:15am,emily,lottie,No, he was definitely being weird with both of us.
Mar-06,11:20am,lottie,emily,I'm glad it's not just me then. I'm going to talk to him about it.
Mar-06,11:25am,emily,lottie,Be careful, Lottie. He's a bit creepy.
Mar-06,11:30am,lottie,emily,I will. I just want to make sure he knows we're not comfortable with that stuff.
Mar-06,12:00pm,lottie,jack,Hi Jack, we need to talk.
Mar-06,12:15pm,jack,lottie,Hey babe, what's up?
Mar-06,12:20pm,lottie,jack,Emily and I didn't feel comfortable with some of the dares last night.
Mar-06,12:25pm,jack,lottie,Oh, why not? It was just a bit of fun.
Mar-06,12:30pm,lottie,jack,It didn't feel like just fun. It felt like you were trying to get us to do stuff we didn't want to do.
Mar-06,12:35pm,jack,lottie,I'm sorry if it came across like that. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.
Mar-06,12:40pm,lottie,jack,Ok, well just don't do it again.
Mar-06,12:45pm,jack,lottie,I won't, I promise. I care about you too much to make you feel uncomfortable.
Mar-06,12:50pm,lottie,jack,Ok, good.
Mar-06,1:00pm,jack,emily,Hey Emily, Lottie told me you felt uncomfortable with some of the dares last night. I'm really sorry if I made you feel that way.
Mar-06,1:15pm,emily,jack,It's ok, just don't do it again.
Mar-06,1:20pm,jack,emily,I won't, I promise. I care about you and Lottie too much to make you feel uncomfortable.
Mar-07,8:30pm,jack,lottie,I've been thinking about you all day. I can't wait to see you again.
Mar-07,8:35pm,lottie,jack,Me too. But I don't want to do anything that makes me feel uncomfortable.
Mar-07,8:40pm,jack,lottie,Of course not, babe. We'll only do what you're comfortable with. I promise.
Mar-07,8:45pm,jack,emily,I can't stop thinking about you, Emily. You're so beautiful.
Mar-07,8:50pm,emily,jack,Thanks, Jack.
Mar-07,8:55pm,jack,emily,I want to see you again soon. Just the three of us, like before.
Mar-07,9:00pm,emily,jack,I don't know, Jack. I'll think about it.
Mar-08,7:45pm,lottie,emily,Jack keeps messaging me, trying to get me to meet up with him.
Mar-08,7:50pm,emily,lottie,He's doing the same with me. I don't know what to do.
Mar-08,7:55pm,lottie,emily,I think we should meet up with him, but only if we're both there. That way we can look out for each other.
Mar-08,8:00pm,emily,lottie,That's a good idea. Let's do that.
Mar-08,8:15pm,lottie,jack,Emily and I will meet up with you, but only if we're both there.
Mar-08,8:20pm,jack,lottie,That's fine with me, babe. I can't wait to see you both.
Mar-08,8:25pm,lottie,jack,Ok, we'll meet you tomorrow after school.

Mar-09,4:05pm,lottie,jack,We're here. Where are you?
Mar-09,4:10pm,jack,lottie,I'm by the swings. Come join me.
Mar-09,4:15pm,lottie,emily,Let's go, Em. He's by the swings.
Mar-09,4:20pm,emily,lottie,Ok, let's stick to the plan. We won't do anything we don't want to.
Mar-09,4:30pm,jack,lottie & emily,Hey girls, you both look amazing.
Mar-09,4:35pm,lottie,jack,Hi Jack. Thanks.
Mar-09,4:40pm,emily,jack,Hey.
Mar-09,4:45pm,jack,lottie & emily,So, I was thinking we could go somewhere more private. There's a hidden spot just over there.
Mar-09,4:50pm,lottie,jack,I don't know, Jack. We're fine here, aren't we, Em?
Mar-09,4:55pm,emily,jack,Yeah, I agree with Lottie. We should stay here.
Mar-09,5:00pm,jack,lottie & emily,Ok, ok. We can stay here. Let's play truth or dare again. It'll be fun.
Mar-09,5:05pm,lottie,jack,I'm not sure, Jack. Remember what happened last time?
Mar-09,5:10pm,jack,lottie & emily,Come on, girls. It's just a bit of fun. I promise I won't make you do anything you don't want to.
Mar-09,5:15pm,emily,lottie,What do you think, Lottie?
Mar-09,5:20pm,lottie,emily,Ok, but we stop if it gets too much.
Mar-09,5:25pm,jack,lottie & emily,Great! Let's start. Lottie, truth or dare?
Mar-09,5:30pm,lottie,jack,Truth.
Mar-09,5:35pm,jack,lottie,Ok, have you ever kissed a girl?
Mar-09,5:40pm,lottie,jack,Ew, no! My turn. Emily, truth or dare?
Mar-09,5:45pm,emily,lottie,Truth.
Mar-09,5:50pm,lottie,emily,Have you ever had a secret admirer?
Mar-09,5:55pm,emily,lottie,Not that I know of. Ok, Jack, truth or dare?
Mar-09,6:00pm,jack,emily,Dare.
Mar-09,6:05pm,emily,jack,I dare you to climb that tree over there.
Mar-09,6:10pm,jack,emily,Ok, easy. Watch this.
Mar-09,7:30pm,lottie,emily,"I'm glad we stuck together. I felt safer with you there."
Mar-09,7:35pm,emily,lottie,"Me too. We make a good team."
Mar-09,7:40pm,lottie,emily,"Let's promise not to meet up with him alone, ok?"
Mar-09,7:45pm,emily,lottie,"Definitely. We should look out for each other."
Mar-09,8:00pm,jack,lottie,"Hey babe, I had a great time today. When can we meet up again?"
Mar-09,8:15pm,lottie,jack,"I don't know, Jack. I've got a lot of homework this week."
Mar-09,8:20pm,jack,lottie,"Ok, well let me know when you're free. I really want to see you again."
Mar-09,8:25pm,jack,emily,"Hey Emily, it was great seeing you today. We should do it again soon."

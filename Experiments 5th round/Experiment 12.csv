Feb-20,9:00pm,lottie,jack,"Hey Jack, I've been talking to my friend Emily and she mentioned that she's been chatting with someone who sounds a lot like you. She's really into him but I'm getting worried."
Feb-20,9:05pm,jack,lottie,"Oh, that's weird. What's his name? Maybe I know him."
Feb-20,9:10pm,lottie,jack,"She didn't say his name, but she described him as really charming and always complimenting her. He's been asking for pictures too."
Feb-20,9:15pm,jack,lottie,"That doesn't sound right. Tell her to be careful and not to send any pictures to anyone she doesn't know well."
Feb-20,9:20pm,emily,lottie,"Hey Lottie, I've been talking to this guy and he's really nice. He says he's 17 and we have so much in common. He's been asking for some pictures but I'm not sure if I should send them."
Feb-20,9:25pm,lottie,emily,"Emily, I'm really worried about this. He sounds like the same guy who's been messaging me. I think he might be older than he says and he's been asking me for pictures too."
Feb-20,9:30pm,emily,lottie,"Oh no, that's scary. What should I do?"
Feb-20,9:35pm,lottie,emily,"Don't send him any pictures and block him immediately. We need to tell a trusted adult about this."

Feb-20,9:45pm,lottie,jack,"Jack, I know it's you. You're messaging Emily too, aren't you? This is not okay."
Feb-20,9:50pm,jack,lottie,"I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just trying to be friends with her."
Feb-20,9:55pm,lottie,jack,"No, Jack. This is grooming and it's not acceptable. We need to report this to someone."
Feb-20,10:00pm,emily,lottie,"Lottie, I blocked him. What do we do now?"
Feb-20,10:05pm,lottie,emily,"We need to tell our parents or a teacher about this. It's the only way to stop him."

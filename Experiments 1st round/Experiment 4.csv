Discussion of results (copy the results from Weka etc.):
·         ChatGTP generated the following after instructing it to generate a more aggressive scenario from the data
·         Task 3: Review the content to identify any risks and create an action plan for mitigating them.
·         Identified Risks:
"·         Age Disparity: Lottie, who is presumably younger, is engaging with an 18-year-old. This age difference could pose risks of exploitation or inappropriate behavior."
"·         Secretive Behavior: Lottie is hiding her interactions with Jack from her mother, indicating a lack of transparency and potential risks."
·         Fast-Paced Relationship: The rapid progression from meeting to planning private meet-ups suggests a need for caution and evaluation of Jack’s intentions.
·         Online Interactions: Communicating through social media platforms can increase the risk of inappropriate content sharing and lack of parental oversight.
·         Action Plan to Mitigate Risks:
·         Parental Involvement:
·         Encourage Lottie to communicate openly with her mother about her interactions and plans.
·         Suggest setting boundaries for social interactions and involving parents in meeting decisions.
·         Education on Online Safety:
·         Provide Lottie with resources and information on safe online communication practices.
·         Educate her on the potential dangers of sharing personal information and meeting people online.
·         Supervised Meetings:
·         Propose that any meetings with Jack be supervised or take place in public areas to ensure safety.
·         Involve a trusted adult or friend in initial meetings to observe and ensure appropriate behavior.
·         Regular Check-ins:
·         Establish regular check-ins with Lottie to discuss her feelings and experiences with Jack.
·         Monitor changes in behavior or communication patterns that might indicate discomfort or pressure.
·         Support Network:
·         Ensure Lottie has a support network of friends and family she can turn to if she feels uncomfortable or pressured.
·         Encourage open dialogue about her experiences and feelings.
"·         By implementing these strategies, the risks identified can be managed, promoting Lottie’s safety and well-being in her interactions with Jack."

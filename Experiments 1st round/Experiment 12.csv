·         There are several harmful and inappropriate comments in this conversation. Here are some of them:
"·         Lottie and Chloe's plan to meet boys from other schools could potentially be dangerous, as they could end up meeting strangers who may have bad intentions."
"·         Lottie's decision to accept a friend request from an 18-year-old boy she met at a club is also risky, as he is much older than her and could have bad intentions."
"·         Jack's messages to Lottie are inappropriate and could be considered grooming behavior. He compliments her appearance and tries to flatter her, which could be seen as an attempt to gain her trust and build a relationship with her for his own benefit. He also asks her to meet up with him and sends her messages that are sexually suggestive, which is not appropriate behavior for someone who is 18 years old communicating with someone who is younger."
"·         Lottie's decision to keep her relationship with Jack a secret from her mother is also concerning, as it could put her in a dangerous situation if her mother is not aware of who she is communicating with and where she is going."
"Overall, this conversation contains several harmful and inappropriate comments that could potentially put Lottie in danger. It is important for young people to be cautious when communicating with others online and to be aware of the risks associated with meeting strangers in person."

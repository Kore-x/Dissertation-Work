"·         Lottie was sitting in her room, scrolling through her messages when she came across the one from Jack that made her feel uncomfortable. He had been asking for pictures of her in her underwear and it made her feel uneasy. She had been talking to him for a while now and he had always been nice to her, but this request made her question his intentions."
"·         She decided to confront him about it. She typed out a message, her fingers shaking slightly as she did so. ""Hey Jack, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with sending you those kinds of pictures. I thought you liked me for me, not just my body."""
"·         She hit send and waited anxiously for his response. It felt like hours, but it was only a few minutes before her phone buzzed with a notification. It was from Jack. ""I'm sorry, Lottie. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. I do like you for you, I promise. I was just caught up in the moment and I didn't think about how it might make you feel. I'm really sorry."""
"·         Lottie let out a sigh of relief. She was glad he had apologized and that he understood how she felt. ""It's okay, Jack. I just want to make sure we're on the same page. I like you too, but I'm not ready for that kind of thing."""
"·         ""I understand,"" Jack replied. ""I'll respect your boundaries and I promise I won't ask for anything like that again. I really do care about you, Lottie."""
"·         Lottie smiled. She was glad she had stood up for herself and that Jack had listened. She knew it was important to set boundaries in any relationship and she was proud of herself for doing so. She and Jack continued to talk, but Lottie felt more comfortable knowing that he respected her and her boundaries."

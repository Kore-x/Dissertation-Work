"·         In the afternoon, Lottie sat at her computer, chatting with Chloe about her new relationship with Jack. Their conversation was lively and full of excitement until Chloe sent a message that made Lottie’s heart skip a beat."
·         Chloe: “Thats weird. My bro is on that team and I don’t think he knows Jack :/”
·         Lottie: “I might…”
"·         Lottie’s fingers hovered over the keyboard as she tried to think of a response. A slight unease settled in her chest. She liked Jack a lot, but she realized she didn’t know everything about him. Chloe’s brother was indeed on the Black Horse team, and it was strange he hadn’t mentioned Jack before."
"·         Before she could respond, her phone buzzed with a new message from Jack."
·         Jack: “I like having you ALL to myself. Xx”
"·         A warm smile spread across Lottie’s face as she read Jack’s message, but the unease lingered. She needed to be honest with Chloe and clear the air."
"·         Lottie: “Hey Chloe, can we talk privately?”"
"·         Chloe: “Sure, what’s up?”"
"·         Lottie: “I know it sounds weird about the football team. Maybe Jack isn’t in the main team, or he could be new. I haven’t known him long, and I haven’t met his friends either. But he’s been really sweet to me.”"
·         Chloe took a moment before replying.
"·         Chloe: “I get it, Lottie. Just be careful, ok? Sometimes people aren’t what they seem.”"
"·         Lottie: “I know, Chloe. Thanks for looking out for me. I’ll talk to Jack about it.”"
"·         Feeling reassured by Chloe’s understanding, Lottie decided to confront Jack. She picked up her phone and typed a message."
"·         Lottie: “Hey Jack, I was talking to my friend about you being on the Black Horse team. Her brother is on it too and didn’t recognize your name. Can you clear that up for me?”"
"·         The wait for his response felt like an eternity. When it finally came, she took a deep breath before reading it."
"·         Jack: “Oh, I see the confusion. I’m not in the main team; I play for their weekend league sometimes. I guess we just haven’t crossed paths. Don’t worry, you can meet some of my friends soon.”"
"·         Lottie felt a bit more at ease. His explanation made sense, and she decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. Trust was important, but she would stay cautious and observant."
"·         Returning to her chat with Chloe, Lottie shared Jack’s explanation."
"·         Lottie: “Jack said he plays in a different league for the same club, that’s why your brother might not know him. He also said I can meet his friends soon.”"
"·         Chloe: “Alright, that makes sense. Just promise me you’ll be careful and let me know if you ever feel weird about anything.”"
"·         Lottie: “I promise. Thanks for being there for me, Chloe.”"
"·         Later that evening, Lottie couldn’t shake the feeling that she needed to protect herself. She decided to keep a closer eye on Jack’s behavior and make sure she wasn’t getting into something she couldn’t handle. She felt stronger knowing she had friends like Chloe who had her back."

·         Here's a scenario where Lottie defends herself:
·         Lottie becomes increasingly uncomfortable with Jack's requests for intimate photos and his pressuring her to engage in sexual activities. She realizes the relationship is unhealthy and decides to end it.
"·         Lottie: Jack, I've been thinking a lot about our relationship. I'm not comfortable with the direction things have been going. I don't want to send you any more photos or meet up alone at your house. I think it's best if we stop seeing each other."
·         Jack: What? But I love you! We're so good together. Don't throw this away.
"·         Lottie: I'm sorry, but my mind is made up. I deserve to be in a relationship where I feel respected and comfortable. Please don't contact me anymore."
·         Jack: You can't do this to me! I'll show everyone those photos you sent me!
"·         Lottie: That would be illegal. I've saved our conversations as evidence. If you share those photos or try to blackmail me, I'll report you to the police. I'm blocking you now. Do not try to contact me again."

February 25,6:15pm,Lottie,Bella,"Hey Bella, guess what? I finally introduced Jack to you guys today. What did you think of him?"
February 25,6:20pm,Bella,Lottie,"Hey Lottie! Jack seems nice, but there's something about him... I don't know, just be careful, okay?"
February 25,6:25pm,Lottie,Bella,"What do you mean? He’s been really sweet to me, Bella. He even met Mum the other night. She likes him!"
February 25,6:32pm,Bella,Lottie,"I'm glad your mum likes him, but just promise you'll be careful. Sometimes people aren’t what they seem online. I just don’t want to see you get hurt."
February 25,6:38pm,Lottie,Bella,"I get it, but I really trust him. We’ve been talking for a while now, and he’s always been there for me. He’s coming to a party on Friday—maybe you’ll see a different side of him?"
February 25,6:40pm,Bella,Lottie,"Maybe! Just keep your eyes open, okay? And if anything feels off, you know you can always talk to me."
February 25,6:50pm,Lottie,Bella,"Thanks, Bella. I appreciate it. I know you’re just looking out for me."
February 25,6:55pm,Bella,Lottie,"Always! So, what’s the plan for Friday? Is Jack coming with us, or is he meeting us there?"
February 25,7:00pm,Lottie,Bella,"He said he’d meet us there. I thought it might be less awkward that way, you know? Just us girls first!"
February 25,7:05pm,Bella,Lottie,"Good call! We can catch up and have some fun before the boys join in. What are you going to wear? I’m thinking of that new dress I got."
February 25,7:10pm,Lottie,Bella,"Ooh, that dress will look amazing on you! I’m still deciding... Maybe my blue top and black skirt? Jack said he likes that outfit."
February 25,7:15pm,Bella,Lottie,"That sounds perfect! You’ll look great. Just make sure you’re comfortable. It’s going to be a long night!"
February 25,7:20pm,Lottie,Bella,"I will! Can’t wait for Friday. We’re going to have so much fun!"
February 26,8:50am,Bella,Jack,"Hey Jack, it was nice meeting you yesterday. Just wanted to say, you better treat Lottie well. She's my best friend."
February 26,9:05am,Jack,Bella,"Hey Bella, don’t worry, I really care about Lottie. She’s special to me. I’d never hurt her."
February 26,9:10am,Bella,Jack,"Good to hear. Just wanted to make sure. We’ve been friends forever, so I’m pretty protective."
February 26,9:15am,Jack,Bella,"I get that. It’s nice to know she has someone looking out for her. I’ll make sure to do the same."
February 26,9:30am,Bella,Lottie,"Morning Lottie! So, I messaged Jack this morning to let him know that he better treat you right. You know, best friend duties! ;) How’s your day going?"
February 26,9:45am,Lottie,Bella,"Haha, thanks for looking out for me! I’m good, just getting ready for school. Can’t wait for Friday!"
February 26,9:50am,Bella,Lottie,"Same here! Should be fun. Just don’t spend the whole night glued to Jack’s side, okay? We need some girl time too!"
February 26,9:55am,Lottie,Bella,"Don’t worry, I won’t forget about you! We’ll have a blast."
February 27,3:00pm,Lottie,Bella,"Bella, you won’t believe what Jack did today! He sent me flowers to school, just because I mentioned I was stressed about the history test."
February 27,3:10pm,Bella,Lottie,"Wow, that’s sweet of him! How do you feel about it?"
February 27,3:15pm,Lottie,Bella,"I loved it! It was such a nice surprise. No one’s ever done something like that for me before."
February 27,3:20pm,Bella,Lottie,"That’s really thoughtful. It’s good that he’s making an effort. How did the test go, by the way?"
February 27,3:25pm,Lottie,Bella,"It wasn’t too bad! I think I did okay. Thanks for helping me study last night."
February 27,3:30pm,Bella,Lottie,"Anytime! Glad it went well. Maybe we should reward ourselves with a movie night this weekend?"
February 27,3:35pm,Lottie,Bella,"Sounds like a plan! Let’s do it."
February 28,5:00pm,Bella,Lottie,"So, how was your day? I saw Jack waiting for you after school again. You two seem pretty close."
February 28,5:10pm,Lottie,Bella,"Yeah, we are. He’s been really supportive lately. I feel like I can talk to him about anything."
February 28,5:15pm,Bella,Lottie,"That’s great, Lottie. Just make sure you’re not losing yourself in the relationship, okay? You’re amazing on your own too!"
February 28,5:20pm,Lottie,Bella,"Thanks, Bella. I’m trying to keep a balance. You know how exciting it is when you start dating someone new!"
February 28,5:25pm,Bella,Lottie,"Oh, I totally get it! Just don’t forget about your friends. We miss you!"
February 28,5:30pm,Lottie,Bella,"Never! I’ll make more time for us, I promise. How about lunch tomorrow?"
February 28,5:35pm,Bella,Lottie,"Yes, please! Let’s do it. I’ll bring snacks."
March 1,9:15pm,Jack,Bella,"Hey Bella, about that party on Friday—can you keep an eye on Lottie? I want her to have fun, but I also want to make sure she’s okay."
March 1,9:20pm,Bella,Jack,"Of course. I always look out for her. Just make sure you do the same."
March 1,9:25pm,Jack,Bella,"Definitely. I really want her to have a good time. Thanks for being a good friend to her, Bella."

March 2,10:15am,Lottie,Bella,"Yay! Can’t wait to dance to it. I’m feeling so good about tonight."
March 2,12:00pm,Bella,Lottie,"By the way, are you sure you’re okay with Jack meeting us there? It’s going to be a little crowded."
March 2,12:05pm,Lottie,Bella,"Yeah, he’s fine with it. I think he likes that we’re all going together. Less pressure for him."
March 2,1:30pm,Bella,Lottie,"That’s good. I’m glad he’s being so understanding. Let’s just make sure we all stick together once we’re there."
March 2,1:35pm,Lottie,Bella,"For sure. Safety in numbers, right? And besides, we’re going to have a blast!"
March 2,3:45pm,Bella,Lottie,"Okay, so I’m thinking we meet at my place around 7? We can get ready together and pregame a little."
March 2,3:50pm,Lottie,Bella,"Perfect! I’ll bring some snacks and maybe a bottle of wine?"
March 2,3:55pm,Bella,Lottie,"Sounds good! Just a little though, don’t want to overdo it before the party!"
March 2,6:00pm,Lottie,Bella,"I’m almost ready! Just doing my hair. See you soon!"
March 2,6:05pm,Bella,Lottie,"Same here! I’ve got the music going and everything set up. Can’t wait to see you!"
March 2,6:45pm,Lottie,Jack,"Hey, just wanted to remind you about tonight! I’ll be at Bella’s first, and then we’ll see you at the party."
March 2,6:50pm,Jack,Lottie,"Sounds good! I’m really looking forward to it. See you soon, babe."
March 2,7:30pm,Bella,Lottie,"You look amazing! That blue top was definitely the right choice."
March 2,7:35pm,Lottie,Bella,"Thanks! And you’re rocking that dress! We’re going to turn some heads tonight."
March 2,8:00pm,Bella,Lottie,"Let’s take a few pictures before we go. We need to document how fabulous we look!"
March 2,8:05pm,Lottie,Bella,"Absolutely! These are going straight to Instagram."
March 2,9:30pm,Bella,Jack,"Just arrived at the party. Lottie seems excited. Where are you?"
March 2,9:35pm,Jack,Bella,"Just got here too. I’ll find you guys in a minute."
March 2,9:40pm,Lottie,Bella,"Jack’s here! We’re grabbing drinks—want anything?"

March 2,10:30pm,Lottie,Bella,"This party is amazing! The music, the people—it’s all perfect."

March 2,10:40pm,Lottie,Bella,"Yeah, he’s great! We just danced for like half an hour straight. How about you? Any cute guys caught your eye?"
March 2,10:45pm,Bella,Lottie,"Not yet, but I’m having fun just hanging out and dancing. Maybe later!"
March 2,11:15pm,Bella,Lottie,"Hey, everything okay? Haven’t seen you for a bit."
March 2,11:20pm,Lottie,Bella,"Yeah, just outside with Jack. It’s a bit noisy inside."
March 2,11:25pm,Bella,Lottie,"Okay, just checking. Let me know if you need anything."
March 2,11:45pm,Lottie,Bella,"Jack just suggested we leave soon. He’s got something planned, but he won’t tell me what!"
March 2,11:50pm,Bella,Lottie,"Ooh, sounds intriguing! Let me know how it goes. I’m probably going to head home soon too."
March 3,12:10am,Bella,Lottie,"It’s getting late. Do you need a ride home? I can call an Uber."
March 3,12:15am,Lottie,Bella,"No worries, Jack said he’d drop me off. Thanks though! Talk tomorrow?"
March 3,12:20am,Bella,Lottie,"Alright, stay safe. And yeah, let’s catch up tomorrow. Night!"

March 3,12:35am,Bella,Jack,"Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it. Good night."
March 3,10:00am,Bella,Lottie,"Morning! How was the rest of your night? What was Jack’s surprise?"
March 3,10:15am,Lottie,Bella,"Morning! It was so sweet—he took me to this quiet spot by the lake, and we just talked and looked at the stars. I had such a great time."
March 3,10:20am,Bella,Lottie,"That sounds amazing! I’m so happy for you. Jack really seems to be making an effort."

March 3,10:35am,Lottie,Bella,"Thanks, Bella. I’m really glad we have each other. How was your night? Did you end up staying late?"
March 3,10:40am,Bella,Lottie,"It was good! I stayed a bit longer, danced some more, and then headed home. Nothing too exciting, but it was fun."
March 3,10:45am,Lottie,Bella,"Sounds like a good time! We should plan another night out soon—just us girls this time."
March 3,10:50am,Bella,Lottie,"Yes, definitely! Let’s do it. Maybe next weekend?"
March 3,10:55am,Lottie,Bella,"Next weekend sounds perfect. Can’t wait!"
March 4,8:00pm,Lottie,Bella,"Bella, I’ve been thinking a lot about everything lately. I’m really happy with Jack, but I also don’t want to lose touch with you. Can we have a girls’ night soon?"
March 4,8:10pm,Bella,Lottie,"Lottie, you’ll never lose me. We’ve been through too much together. A girls’ night sounds perfect. How about this Friday? We can do facemasks, watch movies, and just relax."
March 4,8:15pm,Lottie,Bella,"That sounds amazing! Let’s do it. I’ve missed our time together."
March 4,8:20pm,Bella,Lottie,"Me too! It’ll be just like old times. Can’t wait!"
